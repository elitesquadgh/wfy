/**
 * \page fapi_page The Form API
 * The Form API is a simple API which makes it possible to define forms
 * in PHP and have the forms rendered in HTML. This API provides server
 * side validation. The form API is made up of a collection of classes
 * which are all based on a single element class. This API is very extensible.
 * 
 * \section how_fapi_works How the form API Works
 * The form api is orgarnised around the Element class. This class is extended
 * by two other abstract classes; Field and Container. Subclasses of the Container 
 * class are used to contain other Elements. Subclasses of the Field class
 * are used to collect the form's data. Some of the subclasses of the container
 * class are the Form, FieldSet and BoxContainer class. Some of the subclasses
 * of the Field class are the TextField, TextArea etc.
 * 
 * \section using_fapi Using the form API
 * The following listing shows a simple usage of the form api. This listing
 * creates a simple form intended to get information to be stored in an
 * address book. Embeding this code anywhere within a PHP document should cause the
 * document to render an HTML form definition.  
 * 
 * \code
 * <?php
 * $form = new Form();
 * $fieldset = new FieldSet("Address Book");
 * $form->add($fieldset);
 * 
 * //Create a field. The first parameter of the constructor is the label.
 * //The second parameter is the name and the third is a description.
 * $firstname = new TextField("Firstname","firstname","The firstname of the person.");
 * $fieldset->add($firstname);
 * 
 * $lastname = new TextField("Lastname","lastname","The lastname of the person.");
 * $fieldset->add($lastname);
 * 
 * $email = new EmailField("Email","email","The e-mail address of the person.");
 * $fieldset->add($email);
 * 
 * $address = new TextArea("Address","address","The address of the person");
 * $fieldset->add($address);
 * 
 * $form->render();
 * ?>
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \subsection intercepting_data Intercepting the Form data.
 * By default the form transmits all its data using the HTTP post method. This
 * can be changed by calling the setMethod method of the Form class.
 * \code
 * $form->setMethod("GET");
 * \endcode
 * Although either GET or POST methods are used to send the form, 
 * to intercept the data that was entered into the form, it is
 * advisable to use a call back function within your program. This is 
 * because for security reasons, the element names sent are sometimes
 * encrypted to prevent the HTML code from containing any information
 * about the internal database structure. A call back function is just
 * any regular function within your program. You pass the function name
 * as a string to the form class by calling the \c setCallback() method.
 * 
 * \code
 * $form->setCallback("my_function")
 * \endcode
 * 
 * The function passed should accept one parameter. This parameter would
 * contain a structured array whose keys are the field names, and values
 * are the values passed to the form. Adding a callback method to the 
 * above code would give the following.
 * 
 * \code
 * <?php
 * function form_callback($data)
 * {
 *     print_r($data);
 * }
 * 
 * $form = new Form();
 * $form->setCallback("form_callback");
 * $fieldset = new FieldSet("Address Book");
 * $form->add($fieldset);
 * 
 * //Create a field. The first parameter of the constructor is the label.
 * //The second parameter is the name and the third is a description.
 * $firstname = new TextField("Firstname","firstname","The firstname of the person.");
 * $fieldset->add($firstname);
 * 
 * $lastname = new TextField("Lastname","lastname","The lastname of the person.");
 * $fieldset->add($lastname);
 * 
 * $email = new EmailField("Email","email","The e-mail address of the person.");
 * $fieldset->add($email);
 * 
 * $address = new TextArea("Address","address","The address of the person");
 * $fieldset->add($address);
 * 
 * $form->render();
 * ?>
 * \endcode
 * 
 * After this interception you can do anything you want to do with the data in the callback
 * function.

/**
 * The Form class is the main Container for all forms. This form class renders
 * HTML forms. This class is mostly extended to create new forms. In some rare 
 * cases it is directly used and the other
 * elements are added to it. The two examples below show how to use a form by:
 * - Extending the base Form class or.
 * - Using an instance of the base Form class.
 * 
 * 
 * @warning When extending the Form class please be sure to call the parent constructor.
 * 
 * Example login form by extending the Form class.
 * @code
 * class LoginForm extends Form
 * {
 *     parent::__construct();
 *     $this->add(
 *         new TextField("Username", "username"),
 *         new TextField("Password", "password")
 *     )
 * }
 * 
 * $form = new LoginForm();
 * echo $form->render();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example login form from the base form api classes.
 * @code
 * $form = new Form();
 * $form->add(
 *     new TextField("Username", "username"),
 *     new TextField("Username", "username")
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * @ingroup Forms
